Provided that the reference parameter is a const,
the compiler generates a temporary variable in two situations below
- When the actual argument is the correct type but isn't an 'lvalue'
- When the actual argument is of the wrong type, but it's of a tpye that can be converted to the correct type.

lvalue? -> an argument that's an lavalue is a data object that can be referenced by address. 
ex) regular variables and a const variable 
const variable -> non-modifiable lvalue
